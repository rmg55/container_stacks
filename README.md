## Data science containers for geospatial analytics

To facilitate reproducible research, a set of containerized computational environments are defined in this repository. Within each branch, are the scripts and definition files for building the pushing Docker images to [DockerHub]((https://hub.docker.com/u/rowangaffney)). When a branch is modified, a Github Action workflow is triggered to rebuild the image with the ":latest" tag, and is pushed to DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/u/rowangaffney). When a new release in the Github repository is created, the Github Action workflow is triggered and a new image with the "v<release_tagname>" is built and pushed to DockerHub. More details about each container can be found within each branch, but a gneral descriptions are below:
 
 1. **data_science_im_rs**: JupyterLab with geospatial packages in three environments, py_geo (python), py_geo_gpu (python-gpu), and r_geo (R). It also includes proxies RStudio, VSCode (via code-server), and Panel.<br>

4. **master (Depreciated)**:This is the original branch where all the containers were located before they were split by branch. This will be kept around for an indefinite time.
 
<br>

Each active branch contains github actions (in `.github/workflows/`) which will build the image when changes are pushed to the branch (with the _latest suffix), or when a new tag is applied to a commit (with the _tagName suffix).
